Abstract
--------

The first detection of a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, and an
associated short gamma-ray burst confirmed that neutron star mergers
are responsible for at least some of these bursts. The prompt gamma
ray emission from these events is thought to be highly
relativistically beamed. We present a method for inferring limits on
the extent of this beaming by comparing the number of short gamma-ray
bursts observed electromagnetically to the number of neutron star
binary mergers detected in gravitational waves. We demonstrate that an
observing run comparable to the expected Advanced LIGO 2016--2017 run
would be capable of placing limits on the beaming angle of
approximately θ ∈ (2.88°,14.15°), given one binary neutron star
detection. We anticipate that after a year of observations with
Advanced LIGO at design sensitivity in 2020 these constraints would
improve to θ ∈ (8.10°,14.95°).
