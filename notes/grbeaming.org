* "Injection" tests
+ Pick beaming angle (e.g. 15 deg) and some efficiency
+ For those work out expected number of detections
+ Plug this back in and check that the numbers match up



Given some beaming angle, θ, and some efficiency η, how many do we
expect to see in some given time t, given that there are n CBC events.

1. Set "observed GRBs" to zero
2. Draw n values of i from a uniform distribution, cos(i) ~ U(0,1)
3. If i < θ we would observe the GRB, and so we increment "observed GRBs"
4. Repeat this for a range of values of n

* Post GW170817 fall-out


  ￼<15:03:55> "Ik Siong Heng": I was looking at the GRB-GW paper and thinking about that
  ￼<15:04:06> "Daniel Williams [h]": Yeah
  ￼<15:04:25> "Daniel Williams [h]": I'm not sure what effect the top-hat-or-not situation has
  ￼<15:07:14> "Ik Siong Heng": For us, it does because the approach assumes an "on-off" counting
  ￼<15:09:25> "Daniel Williams [h]": Sure
  ￼<15:09:29> "Daniel Williams [h]": That's a good point
  ￼<15:10:45> "Ik Siong Heng": Perhaps the easiest thing to do in the near term is to assume an updated, localised rate based on the detection of GW170817A
  ￼<15:11:06> "Ik Siong Heng": we can convert GW detection volume into redshift
  ￼<15:11:25> "Ik Siong Heng": and then find and appropriate corresponding rate
  ￼<15:11:50> "Ik Siong Heng": and then, we redo the calculation based on that local rate
  ￼<15:12:49> "Ik Siong Heng": Perhaps this is something we should thought of earlier because I think it makes sense to have a GRB beaming limit based on a localised detection volume
  ￼<15:12:54> "Ik Siong Heng": ....maybe
  ￼<15:13:03> "Daniel Williams [h]": Hmm, okay
  ￼<15:13:20> "Ik Siong Heng": Chris may have a little more time now and you could find him to have a chat about this
