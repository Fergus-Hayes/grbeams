\title{Constraints On Short, Hard Gamma-Ray Burst Beaming Angles From
Gravitational Wave Observations}
\author{Daniel Williams, James Clark, Andrew Williamson, Ik Siong Heng}
\date{\today}

\begin{abstract}
Short gamma-ray bursts are high-energy events possibly associated with merging
binary neutron stars and/or neutron star--black hole binaries. These mergers are
promising targets for current gravitational wave detectors. The prompt
electromagnetic emission from a short gamma-ray burst is thought to be beamed,
whereas the gravitational radiation is not. We present a method for inferring
limits on the extent of this beaming by comparing the number of short gamma-ray
bursts observed electromagnetically to the number of neutron star binary mergers
detected in gravitational waves. We demonstrate that a year of observations with
the two Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors should be sufficient to place
an upper limit on the beaming angle of $\sim 40^{\circ}$ under the assumption
that a plausible number of neutron star binaries are detected, and
$\sim 80^{\circ}$ even in the case of no detections. We also demonstrate that
the same detector network is capable of placing a lower limit on the angle of
$4^{\circ}$ after a year with no observations, and $2^{\circ}$ given a plausible
number of detections.

\section{Introduction}

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\acused{GRB} are extremely energetic cosmological events
observed around once per day. There appear to be at least two separate
populations of \acp{GRB}, divided roughly according to their duration and
spectral hardness~\cite{Kouveliotou:1993yx}, although with significant overlap
obscuring any clear distinction between
populations~\cite{Zhang:2009uf,Bromberg:2012gp}.  Both types are
generally associated with systems which are also expected to be
\ac{GW} sources.  Those with long durations ($\gtrsim 2\,s$) and
softer spectra are associated with core collapse
supernovae~\cite{Galama:1998ea,MacFadyen:1998vz,Woosley:2006fn}, while
\acp{sGRB}, which exhibit on avergae harder spectra, are thought to be
related to compact binary coalescences involving at least one
\ac{NS}~\cite{Eichler:1989ve,Paczynski:1991aq,Narayan:1992iy,Lee:2007js}.

The first observation of a \ac{BNS} coalescence event, GW170817, in
August 2017, and its associated electromagnetic emission provided an
abundance of evidence for the connection between \ac{sGRB} and
\ac{BNS}. GW170817 was detected in coincidence as both a \ac{GW}
signal and as a \ac{GRB}, GRB170817A, providing tremendous insight in
the astrophysics of these systems.  The \ac{GW} signal associated with
the \ac{sGRB} confirmed that compact binary merger is the engine for
at least some \ac{sGRB}, and allowed for measurements of the binary
component masses and spins, as well as placing constraints on the
beaming angles and the \ac{NS} equation of state.  Both \BNS and \NSBH
progenitors are possible, with the requirement that a post merger
torus of material accretes onto a compact central
object~\cite{Blandford:1977ds,Rosswog:2002rt,Giacomazzo:2012zt}.  A
population of \JOINT observations could allow us to measure the
fraction of \acp{sGRB} associated with each progenitor
type~\cite{Kreidberg:2012ud}.  A degeneracy between distance and
binary orbital inclination angle means that it will be difficult to
measure the \ac{sGRB} beaming angle based on a single observation.
However, with a population of binary merger sources, with and without
\ac{sGRB} counterparts, we can constrain the average opening
angle~\cite{Clark:2014jpa}.  A population of \JOINT observations with
associated redshifts will enable a relatively systematics-free
measurement of the Hubble parameter at low redshift, which would
provide constraints on cosmological
models~\cite{Schutz:1986gp,Chen:2012qh}.

In this work, we investigate what statements can \emph{currently} be
made on the beaming angle itself using the upper limits placed on the binary
merger rate $\cbcrate$ from all-sky, all-time \ac{GW} searches and explore the
potential for direct inference of \ac{sGRB} beaming angles in the advanced
detector era.  We first discuss the relationship between \acp{sGRB} and compact
binary coalescences.  In particular, we will focus on \BNS inspirals as the
commonly assumed progenitor for \acp{sGRB}.  We then present our method for
robustly inferring the jet opening angles of \acp{sGRB}, using only \ac{GW}
observations.  We demonstrate our method assuming the nominal number of \ac{GW}
signals observed from \BNS inspirals expected for \ac{aLIGO} and Advanced
Virgo in planned observing scenarios, as defined in~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}.
We also show that our approach can
be used to place restrictions on the \ac{sGRB} jet opening angle if
there are no detections, and demonstrate this using results of the
recent first observing run of \ac{aLIGO}, during which no \BNS or
\NSBH signals were observed~\cite{Abbott:2016ymx}.  Finally, we
conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work as well as
possible avenues for further extension of the work presented here.


\section{Short gamma-ray bursts and compact binary coalescences}
\label{sec:sgrbs}
The compact binary coalescence hypothesis for \acp{sGRB} is supported
by a number of observables when compared to longer duration \acp{GRB}, notably:
the larger average separation of \acp{sGRB} from their candidate host
galaxies~\cite{Church:2011gk}, and the lower average star formation rate of
these hosts~\cite{Fong:2013eqa} --- suggesting old progenitor systems that
have undergone significant kicks;
their short durations and rapid variability~\cite{Rees:1994nw} --- suggesting
very compact sources;
and the observation of a kilonova associated with
GRB~130603B~\cite{Berger:2013wna,Tanvir:2013pia}.

At their design sensitivities, the current generation of advanced
\ac{GW} detectors could observe these mergers out to distances of
$\sim 400\,\mpc$ for \BNS or $\sim 1\,$Gpc for \NSBH, each at a rate of
$\sim 1\,$yr$^{-1}$~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}.  It is worth noting that at
galactic or near-galactic distances, \ac{SGR} hyperflares can resemble
\acp{sGRB}.  These \ac{SGR} hyperflares are the likely explanations
for GRB~070201 and GRB~051103, since compact binary coalescences at
the distance of their probable host galaxies were excluded with
greater than $90\%$ confidence \cite{Abbott:2007rh,Abadie:2012bz}.

Given the possible link between \acp{sGRB} and compact binary
coalescences, it is interesting to ask whether the \ac{sGRB} beaming
angle can be inferred from \ac{GW} observations.  For example, a
\JOINT observation could, in principle, constrain the beaming angle by
directly measuring the orbital inclination of the system.  As
discussed in~\cite{Clark:2014jpa}, however, the likely low \ac{SNR} of
such an observation coupled with the degeneracy between orbital
inclination and distance suggest that a comparison of the populations
of observed \acp{sGRB} and \BNS mergers may be more promising.
Motivated by the study in~\cite{2013PhRvL.111r1101C}, we note that if
the \ac{sGRB} population posseses a distribution of beaming angles
then the \emph{observed} rate of \acp{sGRB} is related to the rate of
\BNS coalescences $\cbcrate$ via,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rate2angle}
    \grbrate = \epsilon\cbcrate \left \langle 1-\cos \theta \right \rangle,
\end{equation}
%
where angled brackets $\langle \rangle$ indicate the population mean
and $\epsilon$ is the probability that a binary coalescence results in
an observed \ac{sGRB}.  In this work, we assume
$\grbrate=10$\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$~\cite{Nakar:2007yr,Dietz:2010eh}
and we shall refer to $\epsilon$ as the \ac{sGRB} \emph{efficiency}.
Generally, the efficiency with which \BNS mergers produce \acp{sGRB}
is unknown but will depend on a variety of progenitor physics.  In
particular, a significant fraction of \NSBH systems may be incapable
of powering an \ac{sGRB}~\cite{Pannarale:2014rea}.  Combining this
knowledge with measurements of the binary parameters of of a
population of \JOINT observations could be used to constrain
$\epsilon$.  In this work, we will make no attempt to characterize
$\epsilon$ and we simply aim to provide a framework which allows one
to incorporate various levels of assumptions (or ignorance) regarding
its value.

If the \ac{sGRB} population has a distribution of beaming angles, as would seem
likely from \electro{} observations~\cite{Fong:2015oha}, characterizing the
relative rates of \ac{sGRB} and \BNS coalescence will inform us as to the mean
of that population, $\langle \theta \rangle$.  To explore this point further we
construct a simple Monte Carlo simulation to study the effect on the relative
rates of \acp{sGRB} and \BNS mergers. We arrange the following toy problem:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set the number of `observed \acp{sGRB} to zero: $N_{\mathrm{GRB}}=0$.
    \item Draw $N_{\mathrm{BNS}}$ values of orbital inclination $\iota$ from a distribution which is uniform in $\cos \iota$ in the range $[0,1]$.
    \item For each value of $\iota$, draw a value for the beaming angle $\theta$, from some distribution with finite width and limited to the range $(0,90]^{\circ}$.
    \item If $\iota<\theta$ then this combination of orbital inclination and beaming angle would result in an observable \ac{sGRB}, so increment $N_{\mathrm{GRB}}$.
\end{enumerate}
%
Such a simulation allows us to study the ratio of the number of
observed \ac{sGRB} to the total number of \BNS mergers
$N_{\mathrm{GRB}}/N_{\mathrm{BNS}}$.  Since it is the comparison of
the rates of these events that informs our inference on $\theta$,
studying the ratio $N_{\mathrm{GRB}}/N_{\mathrm{BNS}}$ provides some
intuition as to the effect and features of various $\theta$
distributions.  Figure~\ref{fig:thetapop} plots this ratio as a
function of various truncated normal distributions to demonstrate the
effect of shifting the mean and scaling the width of the distribution.
Points along the $x$-axis correspond to different choices of the
distribution width $\sigma_{\theta}$, and the separate curves
correspond to different choices of the distribution mean
$\langle \theta \rangle$.  Let us denote this truncated normal
distribution ${\mathcal N}(\langle \theta \rangle, \sigma_{\theta})$.
We stress here that such $\theta$ distributions are \emph{not}
intended to represent the true distribution; they are merely intended
to easily demonstrate the qualitative effects of different $\theta$
distributions on the ratio $N_{\mathrm{GRB}}/N_{\mathrm{BNS}}$.

  $(0, 90]$ degrees.\label{fig:thetapop}}

    %     All jet angle distributions are normal, truncated at $(0, 90]$ degrees.
    %     \label{fig:thetapop}}
\end{figure}




Figure~\ref{fig:thetapop} reveals that a population of \ac{sGRB} beaming angles with a large mean but narrow width is, on the basis of rate measurements, indidstinguishable from a population of \ac{sGRB} beaming angles with a small mean and large width.
For example, for the ${\mathcal N}(15,9)$ and ${\mathcal N}(10,13)$ beaming angle populations, the ratios of $N_{\mathrm{GRB}}/N_{\mathrm{BNS}}$ are almost equal ($\sim 4.8\%$).
Thus, a sufficiently wide spread of \ac{sGRB} beaming angles will yield relatively high rates for \BNS and \acp{sGRB} that could lead to an overestimate of the mean beaming angle.
The population-based constraints on $\theta$ must, therefore, be regarded as upper bounds on the mean of a distribution of beaming angles.
Having said this, for a given mean value $\langle \theta \rangle$, the ratio is rather insensitive to the width.


\section{From Rates To Beaming Angles}

In this section, we discuss our approach to estimating the \ac{sGRB} beaming angle based on the binary neutron star inspiral rate, estimated through a number of \ac{GW} observations of \BNS coalescence.
We demonstrate the approach by considering plausible detection scenarios for \ac{aLIGO}~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}.
Our ultimate goal is to develop a generic approach that folds in uncertainties in the \BNS merger rate and our ignorance about the probability with which such mergers actually result in \acp{sGRB}.
%
An overview of the general method is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Estimate the posterior probability distribution on the \BNS merger rate
    in the local Universe from a number of observed gravitational wave signals
    and our knowledge of the sensitivity of the detectors.  We construct a joint
    posterior distribution on the \BNS rate and the (unknown) probability
    $\epsilon$ that a given merger results in a \ac{sGRB}.
\item Use equation~\ref{eq:rate2angle}, which relates the \BNS merger and
    \ac{sGRB} rates via the geometry of the beaming angle, to transform the rate
    posterior probability to a posterior probability on the mean \ac{sGRB}
    beaming angle.
\item Marginalize over $\epsilon$. We choose to consider $\epsilon$ a nuisance
    parameter because, to date, there is no accurate estimate of this parameter
    and it is not the main focus of our analysis. 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Constructing The Rate Posterior}
\label{sec:rate_posterior}
%   Gregory's book, `Logical Data Analysis For The Physical Sciences' has an entire
%   chapter (\S 14) devoted to `Bayesian Inference With Poisson Sampling'.  This
%   seems to match our problem rather well.  In particular, he derives expressions
%   for a Poisson rate posterior in \S 14.3, `Signal + known background' and \S
%   14.4, `Analysis of ON/OFF measurements' (``we want to infer the source rate, s,
%   when the background rate, b, is imprecisely measured'').
%
%It's tempting to jump straight into the On/off measurement stuff in \S~14.4 of
%Gregory, where the construction of the rate posterior includes the raw
%measurements of background rate.  I actually think this over-complicates things;
%if we wanted to do follow that procedure, we have to figure out the expected FAR
%for a given size of template bank etc.  There's a pretty well-established
%procedure for measuring this number: time-slides.  In fact, we don't even have
%to do any analysis.  Figure 3 (left panel) from the observing scenarios paper
%tells us everything we need to know.  Specifically, the following sentance has
%the information we need:

Our goal is to infer the posterior probability distribution for the mean
\ac{sGRB} beaming angle $\theta$ from \ac{GW} constraints on the rate of \BNS
coalescence $\cbcrate$.  The core ingredient to the analysis is the posterior
probability distribution on the coalescence rate $p(\cbcrate|D,I)$, where $D$
represents some \ac{GW} observation and $I$ denotes other unenumerated prior
information.  We will first demonstrate how $p(\cbcrate|D,I)$ may be constructed
for a few projected observing scenarios from~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}.  Later, in
section~\ref{sec:beaming_limits}, we will extend the analysis to place upper
limits on $\theta$ based upon the lack of detection during O1.

To form the posterior on the coalescence rate, we begin by constructing the
posterior on the \emph{signal} rate.  Note that these are not identical since
only those \BNS mergers which occur within a certain range yield a detectable
signal.  \ac{GW} data analysis pipelines (e.g. {\tt
FINDCHIRP}~\cite{2012PhRvD..85l2006A}, {\tt
PyCBC}~\cite{Canton:2014ena,Usman:2015kfa,alex_nitz_2017_844934}) identify
discrete `candidate events' which are characterized by network \acp{SNR},
$\rho_c$, which, for the case of \BNS searches, indicate the similarity between
the detector data and a set of template \BNS coalescence waveforms.  The
measured rate $r$ of these events consists of two components: a population of
true \ac{GW} signals, $s$; and a background rate, $b$, due to noise fluctuations
due to instrumental and environmental disturbances.
%
\begin{equation}
r = s + b
\begin{cases}
s = \text{signal rate} \\
b = \text{background rate}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
Typically for an all-sky, all-time analysis, like that described
in~\cite{Usman:2015kfa}, the significance of a candidate event is
empirically measured against `background' data representative of the
detector noise, which naturally varies from candidate to candidate.  A
detection requires this significance to be above some pre-determined
threshold (e.g. $5\sigma$ for GW150914 and
GW151226~\cite{Abbott:2016blz,Abbott:2016nmj}).  We follow the method
in~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}, which defines a detection as a candidate with
$\rho_c \geq 12$, corresponding approximately to
$b=10^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$.  Since the background rate $b$ is known, we
are just left with the problem of inferring the signal rate $s$.
Assuming a uniform prior on $s$ and a Poisson process underlying the
events, it may be shown (e.g.,~\cite{2010blda.book.....G}) that the
posterior for the signal rate, given a known background rate $b$ and
$n$ events observed over a time period $T$ is,
%
\begin{equation}
p(s|n,b,I) = C \frac{ T\left[(s+b)T\right]^n e^{-(s+b)T}}{n!},
\end{equation}
%
where,
\begin{eqnarray}
C^{-1} & = &\frac{e^{-bT}}{n!} \int_0^{\infty}\diff(sT)(s+b)^n T^n e^{-sT}\\
& = & \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{ (bT)^i e^{-bT}}{i!}.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Finally, we can transform the posterior on the \emph{signal} rate to
the underlying \emph{coalescence} rate via our knowledge of the
sensitivity of the \ac{GW} analysis.  In particular, the signal
detection rate is simply the product of the intrinsic coalescence rate
$\cbcrate$ and the number of \BNS mergers which would result in a
\ac{GW} signal with $\rho_c\geq12$.  Expressing the binary coalescence
rate in terms of the number of mergers per \ac{MWEG}, per year then we
require the number of galaxies $N_{\mathrm{G}}$ which may be probed by
the \ac{GW} analysis.  At large distances, this is well approximated
at large distances by~\cite{rates_paper},
%
\begin{equation}
    N_G = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left( \frac{\dhor}{\mpc}
\right)^3 (2.26)^{-3} (0.0116),
\end{equation}
%
where $\dhor$ is the horizon distance; the distance at which an
optimally-oriented \BNS merger yields $\rho_c\geq12$, the factor of
2.26 results from averaging over sky-locations and orientations, and
$1.16\times 10^{-2}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$ is the extrapolated density of
\ac{MWEG} in space.

Finally, the posterior on the binary coalescence rate $\cbcrate$ is obtained from a trivial transformation of the posterior on the signal rate $s$,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    p(\cbcrate|n,T,b,\dhor) & = & p(s|n,T,b) \left|\frac{\diff s}{\diff \cbcrate}\right| \\
                                   & = & N_G(\dhor)p(s|n,T,b).
\end{eqnarray}
%
We see that in this approach, the rate posterior depends only on the
number of signal detections $n$, the observation time $T$, the
background rate $b$, and the horizon distance of the search $\dhor$.
It is precisely these quantities that comprise the detection scenarios
outlined in~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}.  Before constructing expected rate
posteriors, let us outline the transformation from rate to beaming
angle.

\subsection{Constructing the beaming angle posterior}
Inferences of the \ac{sGRB} beaming angle are made from the posterior
probability density on the beaming angle $p(\theta|D,I)$ where, as
usual, $D$ indicates some set of observations and $I$ unenumerated
prior knowledge.  Our goal is to transform the measured posterior
probability density on the rate $\cbcrate$ to a posterior on the
beaming angle.
%
First, note that we can express the joint distribution
$p(\theta, \epsilon|D,I)$ as a Jacobian transformation of the joint
distribution $p(\cbcrate, \epsilon|D,I)$:
\begin{equation}
p(\theta,\epsilon) = p(\cbcrate,\epsilon)
\left\lvert\left\lvert
\frac{\partial(\cbcrate,\epsilon)}{\partial(\theta,\epsilon)}
\right\rvert\right\rvert,
\end{equation}
%
where we have dropped conditioning statements for notational convenience.
The Jacobian determinant is can be  computed from equation~\ref{eq:rate2angle}.
It is then straightforward to marginalize over $\epsilon$ to yield the posterior on $\theta$ itself:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:beam_posterior}
    p(\theta) & = & \int_{\epsilon} p(\theta,\epsilon)~\diff \epsilon\\
              & = & \int_{\epsilon} p(\cbcrate,\epsilon)
    \left\lvert\left\lvert
    \frac{\partial(\cbcrate,\epsilon)}{\partial(\theta,\epsilon)}
    \right\rvert\right\rvert~\diff \epsilon \\
              & = & \frac{2\grbrate \sin
\theta~p(\cbcrate)}{(\cos\theta-1)^2}\int_{\epsilon}
\frac{p(\epsilon)}{\epsilon} ~\diff \epsilon,
\end{eqnarray}
%
where we have assumed $\epsilon$ and $\cbcrate$ are logically independent such that,
\begin{equation}
p(\epsilon,\cbcrate) = p(\epsilon|\cbcrate)p(\cbcrate) = p(\epsilon)p(\cbcrate).
\end{equation}
%
It is important note that the entire procedure of deriving the jet
angle posterior is completely independent of the approach used to
derive the rate posterior.  In the preceeding section we adopted a
straightforward Bayesian analysis of a Poisson rate which is amenable
to a simple application of plausible future detection scenarios; there
is no inherent requirement to use that method to derive the rate
posterior.

Given the posterior on the rate, $p(\cbcrate)$, the final ingredient
in this approach is the specification of some prior distribution for
$\epsilon$.  \ish{Given the lack of information on the value and
  distribution of $\epsilon$, we choose three plausible priors and
  study their effects on our beaming angle inference.  Our choice of
  priors are:}
%
\begin{description}
\item [Delta-function] $p(\epsilon) = \delta(\epsilon=0.5)$;
        the probability that \BNS mergers yield \acp{sGRB} is known to be 50\%
        exactly.

\item [Uniform] $p(\epsilon)=U(0,1)$;
        the probability that \BNS mergers yield \acp{sGRB} may lie anywhere
    $\epsilon \in (0,1]$ with equal support in that range. 

    \item [Jeffreys] $p(\epsilon)=\beta(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$; treating the
        outcome of a \BNS merger as a Bernoulli trial in which a \ac{sGRB}
        constitutes `success' and $\epsilon$ is the probability of that success,

\section{Prospects For Beaming Angle Constraints With Advanced LIGO}
We now demonstrate the derivation of the rate posterior $p(\cbcrate)$
and the subsequent transformation to the beaming angle posterior
$p(\theta)$.  We consider four \ac{GW} observation scenarios with
\ac{aLIGO} based on the work in~\cite{Aasi:2013wya}.  An observing
scenario essentially consists of an epoch of \ac{aLIGO} operation,
which defines an expected search sensitivity (i.e., \BNS{} horizon
distance $\dhor$) and observation time $T$; as well as an assumption
on the rate of \BNS{} coalescence in the local universe $\cbcrate$.
Each observing scenario ultimately results in an expectation for the
number of observed \acp{GW} from \BNS coalescences.  For this study,
we consider two operation epochs: the 2016 and 2022+ scenarios
described in~\cite{Aasi:2013wya} and we assume the `realistic rate'
for $\cbcrate$ as described in~\cite{rates_paper}.

Our first goal is to establish the expected number of detections in
each scenario.  Given the observation time and horizon distance of the
observation epoch we first compute the 4-volume accessible to the
analysis,
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:search_volume}
    V_{\mathrm{search}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{\dhor}{2.26}\right)^3 \times \gamma T,
\end{equation}
%
where the factor 2.26 arises from averaging over source sky location
and orientation, $T$ is the observation time and $\gamma$ is the
\emph{duty cycle} for the science run.  Following~\cite{Aasi:2013wya},
we take $\gamma=0.5$.  For comparison, during the first observing run
of \ac{aLIGO}, the two interferometers observed in coincidence
achieving $\gamma_{\mathrm{coinc}} = 0.41$.  Where there is a range in
the horizon distances quoted in~\cite{Aasi:2013wya} to account for
uncertainty in the sensitivity of the early configuration of the
detectors, we use the arithmetic mean of the lower and upper bounds
when computing the search volume.  Table~\ref{table:scenarios} lists
the details of each observing scenario.

the observations in the scenarios in table~\ref{table:scenarios}
generated using the procedure described in
section~\ref{sec:rate_posterior}.

We now use these posteriors together with the prior distributions
described in section~\ref{sec:rate_posterior} and the observed rate of
\acp{sGRB} (as described in section~\ref{sec:sgrbs}, we use
$\grbrate=10$\,Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$~\cite{Nakar:2007yr,Dietz:2010eh})
to derive the corresponding beaming angle posteriors.

\subsubsection{Validation}
Before we derive beaming angle posteriors corresponding to the
aforementioned observing scenarios, it is useful to establish some
form of validation for our procedure.  This validation is performed by
first selecting values of the beaming angle, the \ac{sGRB} efficiency,
and the rate of \BNS coalescence.  We choose $\theta=10^{\circ}$, and
the `realistic' \BNS rate $\cbcrate = 10^{-6}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$.
We then compute the value of the \ac{sGRB} rate that would correspond
to these parameter choices.  Finally, we simply use this
\emph{artificial} value for $\grbrate$ in
equation~\ref{eq:beam_posterior} when we compute the posterior on the
beaming angle, with the understanding that the resulting posterior
should yield an inference consistent with the `true' value
$\theta=10^{\circ}$.

  analysis (with the exception of $\epsilon \sim \delta(1.0)$), using
  the same horizon distance, observing time, and duty cycle as the 2015--2016
  observing scenario. to ensure that the correct beaming angle was inferred.

Figures~\ref{fig:injjetposterio2016} and~\ref{fig:injjetposterio2022}
show the beaming angle posteriors which result from this analysis for
the 2015--2016 and 2016--2017 scenarios respectively for each choice
of prior distribution on the efficiency parameter.  Unsurprisingly,
the most accurate constraints arise when we already have the tightest
possible constraints on the \ac{sGRB} efficiency, $\epsilon$.  That
is, the beaming angle posterior arising from the $\delta$-function
prior on $\epsilon$ is the narrowest, yielding the shortest possible
confidence interval.  It is well worth remembering, however, that had
we been incorrect regarding the value of $\epsilon$ when using the
$\delta$-function prior, the result would be significantly biased and
our inference on the beaming angle would be incorrect.  This
highlights the necessity of building a suitable representation of our
ignorance into the analysis.  Finally, we note that the results from
the uniform and Jeffreys distribution priors are broadly equivalent.


\subsubsection{Jet Angle Posteriors From Observing Scenarios}
Figures~\ref{fig:jetposterior2016} and~\ref{fig:jetposterior2022} show
the beaming angle posteriors obtained for two of the detection
scenarios.\footnote{
    A note on implementation: rather than directly evaluating
    the beaming angle posterior in equation~\ref{eq:beam_posterior} we
    choose to sample points from the posterior using a Markov-Chain
    Monte-Carlo algorithm, implemented using the python package
    \texttt{PyMC3}~\cite{salvatier2016probabilistic}.
}\footnote{
    While we present the entire posterior for only these two
    observing scenarios in this section, we provide an overview of all
    of the observing scenarios in section~\ref{sec:future}.}
Since it is a common assumption in related literature, we also now include
a prior on the \ac{sGRB} efficiency which dictates that all \BNS produce a
\ac{sGRB}, $p(\epsilon|I)=\delta(\epsilon=1)$, as well as our previous
strong $\delta$-function prior.  For the 2016 scenario where
inferences are somewhat weak (i.e., broad posteriors) due to the
sparcity of \ac{GW} detections, the uncertainties are large enough
that the results from each prior are broadly consistent.  In the 2022
scenario, where the posterior is more peaked, it is clear that the
strong $\delta$-function priors lead to inconsistent inferences on the
\ac{sGRB} beaming angle.  The much weaker uniform and $\beta$
distributions, by contrast, are again largely consistent with each
other yielding more conservative and robust results, as well as being
a more representative expression of our state of knowledge.  The
inferences drawn from each scenario and each prior are summarised in
terms of the maximum \emph{a posteriori} measurement and the 95\%
credible interval around the maximum in
table~\ref{table:aligo_beam_inference}.

\section{Beaming Angle Constraints With No \ac{GW} Detections}
\label{sec:beaming_limits}
Our proposed approach is also valid in the regime where no \ac{GW}
signals from \BNS coalescence have been observed.  In this case, the
procedure is identical: construct the posterior probability density
function on the \BNS coalescence rate, transform to the joint
posterior on the beaming angle and \ac{sGRB} efficiency, $\epsilon$,
and marginalise over the nuisance parameter $\epsilon$ to yield the
posterior on the beaming angle.  Now, however, rather than quoting the
maximum a posteriori estimate, together with some confidence interval,
we simply integrate the beaming angle posterior from $\theta=0$ until
we reach that value which contains some desired confidence.  Thus, we
obtain an upper limit on the beaming angle, analogous to the rate
upper limits set by past LIGO observations~\cite{Colaboration:2011np}.

%% In this section, we demonstrate the procedure using the \BNS coalescence rate measurements from the final science run of LIGO, prior to the upgrade to \ac{aLIGO}.

%% \arw{Here, and elsewhere, we should change to using O1 upper limits from the O1 BNS/NSBH paper~\cite{Abbott:2016ymx}. These are $\cbcrate=1.21\times 10^{-5}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for `low spin' and $\cbcrate=1.26\times 10^{-5}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for `high spin'.}


%   \subsection{Constructing The Rate Posterior} Our first objective is the
%   construction of the rate posterior.  Since our ultimate goal here is to derive a
%   beaming angle posterior based on initial LIGO observations, it is convenient to
%   adopt the same approach to constructing the rate posterior that was used in past
%   analyses.  Following~\cite{Biswas09,BradyFairhurst08}, the posterior on the
%   binary coalescence rate may be determined from the loudest event in the \ac{GW}
%   analysis and takes the form,
%   %Specifically, for a foreground event rate due to  binary coalescence
%   %$\cbcrate$, the probability of obtaning no events with ranking statistic $\rho$
%   %greater than the observed loudested event $\rhostar$ is,
%   %
%   %\begin{equation} P_F(\rhostar | \cbcrate, C_L, T) = e^{-\cbcrate C_L(\rhostar)
%   %T}, \end{equation}
%   %
%   %where $C_L(\rhostar)$ is the total luminosity to which the search is sensitive
%   %and $T$ is the duration of the search.  The overall probability of obtaining no
%   %events with ranking statistic $\rho>\rhostar$ is the product of obtaining no
%   %such events from foreground \emph{and} the probability of obtaining no such
%   %events from the background in the detector, denoted $P_B(\rhostar)$,
%   %
%   %\begin{equation} P(\rhostar|\cbcrate,I) = P_B(\rhostar|I)e^{-\cbcrate
%   %C_L(\rhostar) T} \end{equation}
%   %
%   %Using a uniform prior on $\cbcrate$ and inverting the overall probability with
%   %Bayes' theorem, we arrive at,
%   %
%   \begin{equation}\label{eq:loudestEventPosterior} p(\cbcrate | C_L({\rhostar}),
%   T, \Lambda) \propto p(\cbcrate) \left[ \frac{1+\Lambda C_L(\rhostar)
%   T}{1+\Lambda}\right] e^{-\cbcrate C_L(\rhostar) T}, \end{equation}
%   %
%   where $p(\cbcrate)$ is the prior probability distribution on the rate, assumed
%   to be uniform, $C_L(\rhostar)$ is the total luminosity to which the search is
%   sensitive, and $T$ is the observation time.  The quantity $\Lambda$ is
%   essentially the relative likelihood that the loudest event arose from a \ac{GW}
%   signal to the likelihood of background.  See section\,3
%   of~\cite{BradyFairhurst08} for the derivation of this distribution and the
%   quantities involved.
%
%   We can now use the published upper limits on the rate of \BNS coalescence to
%   re-derive the full rate posterior.  The upper limit on the binary coalescence
%   rate at confidence $\alpha$ is found by integrating the rate posterior from zero
%   to $\alpha$.  Assuming a uniform prior on the rate $\cbcrate$ and using the rate
%   posterior given by equation~\ref{eq:loudestEventPosterior}, the upper limit on
%   the rate $\cbcrate_{\alpha}$ is given by equation 21 in~\cite{BradyFairhurst08}:
%   %
%   \begin{equation}
%   1-\alpha =  e^{-\cbcrate_{\alpha} C_L(\rhostar)T)}
%   \left[ 
%   1+ \left(\frac{\Lambda}{1+\Lambda}\right) \cbcrate_{\alpha} T C_L(\rhostar)
%   \right ].
%   \label{eq:rateIntegral}
%   \end{equation}
%   %
%   In the event that no \ac{GW} signal has been observed and the loudest event is
%   umabiguously due to background noise fluctuations, we are in the limit in which
%   $\Lambda \rightarrow 0$.
%   In this case, we simply have,
%   \begin{equation}
%   C_L(\rhostar)T = -\frac{\log(1-\alpha)}{\cbcrate_{\alpha}},
%   \end{equation}
%   %
%   %and the value of $\cbcrate$ can be taken straight from the literature
%   %\footnote{Note
%   %that this procedure necessarily confines our jet angle inferences based on
%   %progenitor systems for which the rate upper limits are available.  Given that
%   %the binary coalesence rate limits are quoted for canonical binary neutron star
%   %and neutron star-black hole systems, both plausible sGRB progenitors, this
%   %simply means our inferences on the jet angle are specific to each system and
%   %treated separately.}

%       \label{fig:s6rate}}
%   \end{figure}
%
%   Using the most stringent 90\% confidence upper limit from \ac{GW} observations on the rate of binary neutron star coalescences to date, $\cbcrate^{90\%}_{{\rm BNS}} = 1.3\times 10^{-4}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$~\cite{Colaboration:2011np}, gives $C_L(\rhostar)T=17712$.
%   The full rate posterior from~\cite{Colaboration:2011np} is then found by inserting this value and $\lambda=0$ in equation~\ref{eq:loudestEventPosterior}.
%   The result is shown in figure~\ref{fig:s6rate}.
%
%
%   %Similarly, for NS-BH systems,  $\cbcrate^{90\%}_{{\rm
%   %nsbh}} = 3.1\times 10^{-5}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ gives $C_L(\rhostar)T=74277$.
%   %The posteriors on the rates, assuming these values and $\Lambda=0$, are shown in
%   %figure~\ref{fig:reconstructedRatePosterior}.  

%\subsection{Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:jetposterior2016} shows the four posteriors on the
beaming angle, corresponding to the four priors on the \ac{sGRB}
efficiency, $\epsilon$, using the observing 2015--2016 observing
scenario from table~\ref{table:scenarios}, which corresponds closely
to the conditions of the first science run of the advanced generation
of ground based \ac{GW} detectors.  We define the \emph{upper} limit
on the beaming angle as the upper limit of the 95\% confidence
interval centred on the median of the posterior (i.e. as the 97.5
percentile of the posterior distribution). Similarly we define the
\emph{lower} limit as the lower limit (2.5 percentile) of the same
confidence interval.  In this non-detection scenario, we choose to
compute \emph{upper} limit on the 95\% credible

We see that here, where the rate posterior is rather uninformative,
the results are dominated by the uncertainty in $\epsilon$: there are
substantive differences in the beaming angle upper limits yielded by
the uniform ($U(0,1)$) and $\beta$-distribution priors, while the
$\delta$-function priors yield dramatically different upper limits.
Indeed, the most stringent (and mutually incompatible) upper limits
are obtained using the strong $\delta$-function priors.  In fact,
these beaming angle upper limits are also incompatible with the values
of $3^{\circ}\mbox{-}8^{\circ}$ that have been inferred from
observations of jet breaks in \ac{sGRB}
afterglows~\cite{Fong:2013lba,2006MNRAS.367L..42P,
  2012A&A...538L...7N}.  Recall, however, from the discussion in
section~\ref{sec:sgrbs} that we interpret the beaming angle inference
from our rate measurements as the upper bound on the mean of a
population of beaming angles.  It would, therefore, seem premature to
conclude that there is tension in these results; instead, we can only
state that either the population of \acp{sGRB} have a distributio of
beaming angles with some finite width or that the fraction of \BNS
mergers which yield a \ac{sGRB} is smaller than 0.5.

It is also interesting to compare these upper limits on the beaming
angle with those in~\cite{2013PhRvL.111r1101C}, where the upper limit
on the rate itself is used as a constraint (rather than transforming
the posterior).  This has the important implication that the
constraint thus obtained is the \emph{smallest} angle consistent with
the rate:
%
\begin{equation}
    1 - \cos \theta \geq \frac{\grbrate}{\epsilon \cbcrate^{\mathrm{ul}}},
\end{equation}
%
where $\cbcrate^{\mathrm{ul}}$ is the \emph{upper limit} on the \BNS
rate.  The same idea is used in~\cite{Clark:2014jpa} to estimate
beaming constraints in the advanced detector era.  Thus, when
comparing the constraints in e.g.,~\cite{2013PhRvL.111r1101C} and the
upper limits obtained from the transformed posterior (i.e.,
equation~\ref{eq:beam_posterior} and figure~\ref{fig:s6angle}), one
should remember that they are quite different quantities.  There are
two other noteworthy differences between~\cite{2013PhRvL.111r1101C}
and this work: (i) the rate upper limit is computed based on the
sensitivity of the initial LIGO-Virgo network (see
e.g.,~\cite{BradyFairhurst08}), which gives $\cbcrate=4.5\times
10^{-4}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ (as compared with $\cbcrate=1.3 \times
10^{-4}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ from the analysis
in~\cite{Colaboration:2011np}); and (ii) it is implicitly assumed that
\emph{all} \BNS mergers yield an \ac{sGRB}.  That is, there is no
factor or $\epsilon$ to account for the unknown fraction of mergers
which successfully launch an \ac{sGRB} jet.  With these differences
noted, the lower bound on the beaming angle is found to be $\theta
\geq 0.8^{\circ}$, as compared with our 95\% confidence upper limit
$\theta^{\mathrm{ul}}=1.94^{\circ}$ when assuming $\epsilon=1$.


\section{Beaming Angle Constraints in Future Scenarios}
\label{sec:future}
With the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, and with the
expectation of the detection of \BNS gravitational wave signals during
the lifetime of the advanced detectors it will become possible to
place further constraints on the 95\% credible interval of the sGRB
beaming angle, as both the searched 4-volume of space increases, and
the observed rate of gravitational wave \BNS events is established.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{volume_v_nevents.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:volumevevents} The upper-bound of the 95\%
  confidence limit on the beaming angle as a function of the rate of
  observed gravitational wave BNS events and the observed search
  4-volume, taking a Jeffreys prior on the efficiency of gravitational
  wave production from BNS events. The search volumes corresponding to
  each observing scenario are marked as vertical lines on the plot,
  with each line assuming that observations are carried out over the
  period of one year, achieving the search volume outlined in table
  \ref{table:scenarios}. Note that the labels on each scenario
  correspond to the labels given in the second column of table
  \ref{table:scenarios}, with D corresponding to the 2019+ scenario.}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:volumevevents} we present the inferred upper-limit
on the 95\% confidence interval for a range of search 4-volumes and
gravitational wave event rates; overlayed on this plot are indications
of the anticipated annual search volume for the advanced LIGO
detectors in each of the observing scenarios detailed in table
\ref{tab:scenarios}. These limits were determined by assuming a
Jeffreys prior on the efficiency parameter of the model, and following
the same procedure used to produce the posteriors in figures
\ref{fig:jetposterior2016,fig:jetposterior2022} for scenarios with
search volumes ranging from $0$ to $100 \mpc^3 \yr^{-1}$.

\caption{\label{fig:volumevevents_lower} The lower-bound of the 95\%
  confidence limit on the beaming angle as a function of the observed

  events. The search volumes corresponding to each observing scenario
  are marked as vertical lines on the plot, }
\end{figure}

The lower limit (the 2.5\% of the posterior) for the same range of
scenarios is plotted in figure \ref{fig:volumevevents_lower}, with the
same anticipated detector search volumes plotted.

\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a Bayesian analysis which demonstrates the ability
of the current generation of advanced gravitational wave detectors to
produce observations which will allow the inference of confidence
intervals on the angle at which short Gamma Ray Bursts' jets are
oriented with respect to the orbital inclination of the progenitor
binary neutron star coalensence. In doing so we have made minimal
assumptions about the processes which produce the jet, beyond the
assumption that they are produced by BNS events.

We demonstrate that with a year's worth of gravitational wave
observations by the 2-detector Advanced LIGO network at its design
sensitivity the observation of 15 BNS events in gravitational waves is
sufficient to place an upper limit of $30^{\circ}$ on the jet beaming
angle, while a 3-detector network is capable of establishing this
limit by observing three gravitational wave BNS events in a year.

We also demonstrate that the Advanced LIGO 2-detector network is
capable of establishing a lower limit on the beaming angle of
$2^{\circ}$ with a rate of 15 BNS events per year, while the
three-detector network can establish this limit with 1 detection per
year.
